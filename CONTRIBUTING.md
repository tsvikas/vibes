- **Optional**: install [just][install-just] to use `just` instead of `uv run just`

   git clone https://github.com/tsvikas/vibes.git
   ```

1. Set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   cd vibes
   uv run just prepare
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Tools

- **Format code**: `uv run just format` (runs all the formatting tools)
- **Lint code**: `uv run just lint` (runs all the linting tools)
- **Format and lint code**: `uv run just quick-tools` (runs quick formatting and linting tools)
- **Run tests**: `uv run just test` (runs `pytest`)
- **Run pre-commit tests**: `uv run pre-commit run`. This also runs on each commit.
- **Run all checks**: `uv run just format lint test`
