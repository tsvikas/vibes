Ready to get started? Follow the development setup below.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Install [git][install-git] and [uv][install-uv]
- **Optional**: install [just][install-just] to use `just` instead of `uv run just`

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsvikas/vibes.git
   ```

1. Set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   cd vibes
   uv run just prepare
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Tools

- **Format code**: `uv run just format` (runs `black`)
- **Lint code**: `uv run just lint` (runs `ruff check` and `mypy`)
- **Run tests**: `uv run just test` (runs `pytest`)
- **Run pre-commit tests**: `uv run pre-commit run` (this also runs on each commit)
- **Run all checks**: `uv run just check` (lint, test, and pre-commit)

### Running Individual Tools

You can run specific tools directly:

```bash
uv run black
uv run ruff
uv run mypy
uv run pytest
uv run pre-commit
```
